React Simplified - Beginner

# Basic Components

---

Essential to developing in React is to move from a traditional JavaScript way of thinking, to a **component-based** way of thinking.

You need to think about your application as `components`, rather than an entire application.

Components can encapsulate both small and large elements (i.e. nesting).

Try to separate **distinct elements** that should live on their own (i.e. consider logic, reusability).

For example, page headers may not repeat, but they are **distinct** in their function and logic, and should be their own components.

Consider this question: "If I change **one** of these, do I want **all** of them to change?" If yes, they should be the **same component**.
