# Setup: Vite ESlint

---

`ESlint` gives you warnings and errors for potential issues found within your code. These are declared as `rules`.

For example, it will announce warnings for variables which are declared, but never used.

Via intellisense, you can click on the name of the warning, or error, which will take you to online documentation, breaking down that warning or error.

Oftentimes, ESlint can be too strict for some situations.

In this course, the lecturer won't be covering TypeScript or very much of prop types, so he recommends disabling this rule in ESlint.

To disable an error in ESlint:

1. Find the error you want to disable in your code.
2. Hover over the error, and find the name of the error in the box: `react/prop-types`
3. Go into the `.estlintrc.cjs` file in the root directory.
4. Find the `rules` section, or add it yourself.
5. Add under section: `"react/prop-types": "off",`

Other options are: `"error"`, `"warn"`

You can also use `0` to define off, `1` to define a warning, and `2` to define an error.

If you want to remove ESlint altogether, you can delete the `.eslintrc.cjs` file from your root directory, as well as the `lint` `npm` script from your `package.json`.
